We intelligently clean, deduplicate, merge, and automate data across your tech stack, helping you make better decisions.\n\nThis is a pain I’ve felt before myself, as I helped raise the profile of Product-led GTM strategies, alongside sales and marketing motions: prior to Syncari, I was CEO and founder of Aptrinsic (now Gainsight PX). We raised a Series A, built initial team, developed industry-leading product, created thought leadership through authoring of a highly circulated book on Product Led GTM.\n\nBefore that, I was EVP of Product for Marketo and responsible for engineering, product management, cloud operations and technical support, including privacy services. While with Marketo, we grew from $2.5M to nearly $300M in ARR, experiencing private company growth, a public offering, and eventual sale to PE firm.\n\nHaving built products and gone to market alongside revenue leaders of all stripes - Product, Sales, Marketing, Operations - my goal now is to help you take control of your data, and use it to help your sellers spend less time selling, Increase the efficiency of your marketing spend, and increase knowledge of customers to better prevent churn.\n\nI want to help you gain back the hours you had been spending trying to get behavioral data in front of your sales team, so they can use it to intelligently engage prospects. The late evenings spent uploading and transferring data across Marketo, Zendesk, Salesforce, and all of the other pieces of your stack.\n",
